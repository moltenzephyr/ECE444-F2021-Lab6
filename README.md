## What are the Pros and Cons of TDD?

Some benefits to TDD are 
- ensuring that developers have an automated test suite
- this automated test suite ensures that functionality is maintained as new features are added
- it guarantees that testing is done on code (rather than potentially left to the very end, and then the time allocated for testing gets reallocated elsewhere)
- implementing TDD also grants developers a better understanding of the project requirements.

Some drawbacks to TDD are:
- the tests need to be created before the code is implemented and this process can be time-consuming or difficult
- some things are very difficult to test for (such as usability of a website)
